## üìã How to Use

### Step-by-Step Operation Guide

1. **Choose Operation Type**
   - Select between "Deleted" or "Moved/Renamed" logs
   - Filter events related to your selected operation only

2. **Select Target Path**
   - Choose the location (PATH) for log analysis
   - Only events within this path will be included
   - Example: Selecting C: drive filters all operations within the C: drive

3. **Configure Additional Options**
   - ‚úÖ **Include Security Archive Logs**: Check to include archived security logs
   - üìÅ **Optional Log File**: Select specific EVTX file for targeted analysis
   - ‚è∞ **Time Range**: Define starting and ending time for filtering

4. **Export and Review**
   - üìä **Export**: Save filtered logs to CSV format
   - üîç **Open Exported CSV**: Access recently exported files instantly
   - üìã **Review**: Analyze filtered, well-structured logs

### üîß Parameter Flexibility
All parameters except Starting & Ending Time are completely optional - LogSeeker can run with minimal configuration:

Path Field: Can be left blank to analyze entire system across all drives and locations
Username Field: Can be left blank to include all users, or specify a username to filter by specific user activities
Filename Field: Can be left blank to include all files, or specify filename patterns to locate specific file operations
Checkboxes (Archive Logs, etc.): Can be left unchecked to use default system security logs
Optional Log File: Can be left blank to use current system logs

Only the Operation Type and Starting & Ending Time parameters are required for targeted analysis. All other fields provide additional filtering options but can be omitted for broader system-wide analysis.

This flexibility allows IT professionals to perform comprehensive system-wide analysis or narrow down to highly specific requirements as needed.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **System Administrators**: Monitor file system changes across corporate networks
- **Security Analysts**: Investigate suspicious file operations
- **IT Forensics**: Analyze file deletion and movement patterns
